# Ordered-field leg (`linarith`) demonstration

Exercises the ordered-field `Saturation` leg over `ℚ`: the same engine as the integer
leg, but fed *un-tightened* strict facts and interpreted over an ordered field.  Each
`#guard` runs at elaboration; each `example` produces a kernel-checked proof.

The headline is the **`omega` vs `linarith` contrast**: `0 < x ∧ x < 1` is refutable
over `ℤ` (no integer strictly between `0` and `1`) but *satisfiable* over `ℚ`
(e.g. `x = 1/2`), so the integer leg refutes it and the ordered-field leg does not.  Both
come from one engine, differing only in whether strict inequalities are tightened.

/-! ## Data level: the `omega`/`linarith` contrast on `0 < x ∧ x < 1`.

Variable `0` is `x`.  Strict facts enter the ordered-field engine as genuine `lt`
(no `a < b ↦ a + 1 ≤ b` tightening). -/

/-- `0 < x`. -/
def xPos : Fact := { rel := .lt, form := { terms := [(1, 0)],  const := 0 } }
/-- `0 < 1 - x`  (i.e. `x < 1`). -/
def xLt1 : Fact := { rel := .lt, form := { terms := [(-1, 0)], const := 1 } }
/-- `0 ≤ -x`  (i.e. `x ≤ 0`). -/
def xLe0 : Fact := { rel := .le, form := { terms := [(-1, 0)], const := 0 } }

-- Over ℚ, `0 < x ∧ x < 1` is satisfiable, so the ordered-field engine does NOT refute it…
#guard !(ok? (OrderedField.solve [xPos, xLt1]))
-- …whereas the integer engine, which tightens `<`, DOES refute the same system (`omega`).
#guard ok? (Integer.solve [{ rel := .le, form := { terms := [(1, 0)],  const := -1 } },
                           { rel := .le, form := { terms := [(-1, 0)], const := 0 } }])
-- A genuinely contradictory strict ℚ system (`0 < x ∧ x ≤ 0`) IS refuted (Farkas).
#guard ok? (OrderedField.solve [xPos, xLe0])

/-! ## The tightening contrast: `2x = 1`.

`2x = 1` is integer-infeasible (the integer leg tightens it to `x ≤ 0 ∧ x ≥ 1`) but
*satisfiable* over `ℚ` (`x = 1/2`).  The ordered-field leg performs **no** integrality
tightening, so it correctly does not refute it. -/

/-- `2x ≤ 1`, i.e. `0 ≤ 1 - 2x`. -/
def twoXle1 : Fact := { rel := .le, form := { terms := [(-2, 0)], const := 1 } }
/-- `1 ≤ 2x`, i.e. `0 ≤ 2x - 1`. -/
def twoXge1 : Fact := { rel := .le, form := { terms := [(2, 0)], const := -1 } }

-- Over ℚ, `2x = 1` is satisfiable: not refuted (contrast the integer `2 * x = 1`
-- `kan_saturate` refutation in IntegerDemo, where the tactic tightens it).
#guard !(ok? (OrderedField.solve [twoXle1, twoXge1]))

/-! ## End-to-end: `kan_saturate` closes real `ℚ` goals with a kernel-checked proof.

Contradictory rational hypotheses are refuted by the unified engine through the
ordered-field leg (the `linarith` fragment). -/

/-! ## Denominator clearing: fractional coefficients are cleared to integer ones.

`x / 2 ≤ 1` is reified by scaling through the denominator (`x ≤ 2`), so the engine still
sees only integer-coefficient constraints. -/
